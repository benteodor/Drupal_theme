# Royal Theme - Custom Drupal 11 Theme

**Royal Theme** is a custom-built theme for Drupal 11, created entirely from scratch. It follows Drupalâ€™s theming guidelines and provides a clean, modern look with a focus on simplicity and elegance.

## Customizations
- **Twig Templates**: Custom `page.html.twig`, `node.html.twig`, and `block.html.twig` templates for a unique layout.
- **CSS Styling**: Styles built from the ground up to support the theme's royal design.
- **Typography and Colors**: A focus on elegant fonts and a regal color scheme.
